            <p>
                I am a web developer with a background in
                digital media currently enrolled in my third semester at
                Northeast Wisconsin Technical College. My experience includes videography, video editing, audio
                engineering, photography, image editing, database development, along with web design and
                development.<br><br>
                When not making websites or creating digital media I enjoy getting outdoors, reading, and spending
                time with my family and border collie Easton.
